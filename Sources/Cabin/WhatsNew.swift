/// notes were seen (`lastSeenWhatsNewVersion`). On launch, if that differs from the running
/// version, the card is shown and the marker advances — so it appears exactly once per build,
/// and any version bump re-triggers it. A genuine fresh install (no marker yet) records the
/// version silently: a brand-new player hasn't "updated" to anything.
///
/// To ship notes for a release: bump the version in `package.sh` as usual, then rewrite
/// `items` to describe what changed. Nothing else to wire.
